# BallInTheCup

My Attempt to make "Catch the Ball" kind of game for mobile devices. I am using the unity Game Engine for the development 
using C# as the base library. The game features a 50+ states, which each state bringing some twists and secrets along with it. 
Attempt is to make the states more physics/Geometry driven.
